## Core Concepts

- **Variables & Data Types:** ([variable.js](variable.js))  
  Demonstrates `var`, `let`, `const`, primitive and reference types, and type conversion.

- **Operators:** ([operators.js](operators.js))  
  Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.

- **Conditionals:** ([conditional.js](conditional.js))  
  `if-else`, `switch`, and ternary operator usage.

- **Loops:** ([loops.js](loops.js))  
  `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for...of`, and `for...in` loops.

- **Functions:** ([functions.js](functions.js))  
  Traditional, anonymous, and arrow functions, plus the spread operator.

- **DOM Manipulation:** ([DOM/index.html](DOM/index.html), [DOM/dom.js](DOM/dom.js), [DOM/createandremove.html](DOM/createandremove.html))  
  Selecting, modifying, creating, and removing DOM elements.

- **Event Handling:** ([events.html](events.html), [Event Handling/events.js](Event%20Handling/events.js), [Event Handling/index.html](Event%20Handling/index.html))  
  Inline and external event listeners, mouse and keyboard events.

## Mini Projects

- **Student Grading System:** ([Projects/gradingSystem/grading.html](Projects/gradingSystem/grading.html))  
  Enter student names and scores, display grades and feedback in a table, and clear all entries.

- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:** ([Projects/rockPaperScissors/rps.html](Projects/rockPaperScissors/rps.html))  
  Play against the computer, with score tracking and reset functionality.
